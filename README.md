This Software Side Roads github organization is a set of sample code from Nathan Bossett.  Rather than maintain a private set of notes and examples, I might as well try to give a bit back to the community.  Further, preparing the notes and samples for public view encourages me to be more thorough even when they're not intended to be production-ready code.

The source code and repositories are supplemented by notes and comments at
https://softwaresideroads.com
which also contains some articles and notes which are separate from the strict code part of software develeopment or which are general design comments.

I intend to release simple code samples within this github organization under the MIT or similar license.  Check each repository for the applicable license and the licenses of any third party libraries or other code included.  The softwaresideroads.com blog content is not licensed for reprint/reuse/creation of derivative works.
