# .github
This Software Side Roads github organization is a set of sample code from Nathan Bossett.  Rather than maintain a private set of notes and examples, I might as well try to give a bit back to the community.  Further, preparing the notes and samples for public view encourages me to be more thorough even when they're not intended to be production-ready code.

The source code and repositories are supplemented by notes and comments at
https://softwaresideroads.com
which also contains some articles and notes which are separate from the strict code part of software develeopment or which are general design comments.
